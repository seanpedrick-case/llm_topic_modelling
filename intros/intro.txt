# Create thematic summaries from your data

Extract topics and summarise open text using Large Language Models (LLMs). The model will loop through all text rows to find the most relevant general topics and subtopics, and provide a short summary of each. If you have specific topics in mind, you can enter them in 'Provide a list of specific topics' below.

NOTE: LLMs are not 100% accurate and may produce biased or incorrect responses. All files downloaded from this app **need to be checked by a human** before they are used in further outputs.
